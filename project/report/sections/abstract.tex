\section{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}

This report details our study on classifying human activities using accelerometer data, specifically utilizing the HAR dataset, where smartphones, placed at the waist, recorded data during six distinct activities.
We aimed to develop basic neural networks to effectively classify these activities, with a focus on achieving good performance with models of minimal complexity.
We discovered that minimalistic neural network designs could still yield impressive results, and the hyperparameter optimization techniques employed significantly enhanced these outcomes without substantial increases in complexity.
